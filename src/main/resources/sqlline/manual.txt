Introduction

SQLLine is a pure-Java console based utility for connecting to relational databases and executing SQL commands. It is similiar to other command-line database access utilities like sqlplus for Oracle, mysql for MySQL, and isql for Sybase/SQL Server. Since it is pure-Java, it is platform independant, and will run on any platform that can run Java 1.3 or higher.

License and Terms of Use

SQLLine is distributed under the BSD License, meaning that you are free to redistribute, modify, or sell the software with almost no restrictions. For the text of the license, see the license text.

For information on obtaining the software under another license, contact the copyright holder: mwp1@cornell.edu.

Obtaining SQLLine

SQLLine is hosted on SourceForge, and is located at http://sqlline.sf.net. The latest release can be downloaded from http://sqlline.sf.net/download.html.

Installation

Required software
Installing SQLLine
Required software

SQLLine depends on the following software:

Java™ Virtual Machine - SQLLine is a pure java program, and requires Java version 1.3 or higher in order to run. The latest JVM can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com.

JLine - SQLLine uses the JLine console reader for command line editing, tab-completion, and command history. It can be downloaded from http://jline.sf.net. Version 0.8.1 or higher is required.

JDBC™ Driver(s) - Since SQLLine uses the Java Database Connectivity package to connect to your database, you need to obtain the correct JDBC driver libraries for your database. Any JDBC compliant driver can be used for this purpose. Drivers can be located by referring to the section on known JDBC drivers, or else by referring to your database vendor's web site.

Installing SQLLine

There are currently no set standards for installing Java software on different platforms. The simplest method for installing SQLLine in a platform independant way is as follows:

Create a new directory/folder where you like. This will be referred to as sqllinedir.

Download sqlline.jar into sqllinedir.

Download the latest jline.jar from http://jline.sf.net into sqllinedir.

Download your database's JDBC driver files into sqllinedir. Note that some JDBC drivers require some installation, such as uncompressing or unzipping.

Using SQLLine

Running SQLLine
Connecting to a database
Issuing SQL commands
Command Completion
Running SQLLine

SQLLine can be run with the following command:

java {-Djava.ext.dirs=sqllinedir} {sqllinedir/sqlline.jar} [options...] [properties files...]

For example, if your sqllinedir is /usr/share/java/ (this is typical for Debian Linux), then you might run:

java -Djava.ext.dirs=/usr/share/java/ /usr/share/java/sqlline.jar

Once you have started SQLLine, you will a prompt that reads "sqlline> ". From here, you can enter either SQLLine commands (beginning with a "!" character), or a SQL statement (if you are currently connected to a database). For example, entering "!help" will display a list of all the available commands.

Connecting to a database

SQLLine is only useful once you are connected to a database. In order to do so, you need to use the "!connect" command, with the JDBC URL of the database you are going to connect to, followed by the username and password (followed optionally by the driver class name). The JDBC URL is specific to the JDBC driver that you are using for your database, but will always start with "jdbc:", and usually has the machine name of the database and the name of the database itself as part of the string. Quotes (both single and double) could be used in case of url, username, password contain spaces. Consult your driver's documentation for details on the URL to use.

For example, to connect to an Oracle database, you might enter:


sqlline> !connect jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:mydb scott tiger oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

Connected to: Oracle (version Oracle9i Enterprise Edition Release 9.2.0.1.0 - Production
With the Partitioning, OLAP and Oracle Data Mining options
JServer Release 9.2.0.1.0 - Production)
Driver: Oracle JDBC driver (version 9.0.1.0.0)
Autocommit status: true

0: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:mydb>

Once you are connected, the prompt will change the reflect URL of the current connection.

SQLLine can also accept command line options to connect to a database. If a file is specified on the command line, it will be treated as a properties file, and try to connect to the database specified therein. For details, see the properties command documentation.

SQLLine allows you to have multiple connections to databases (either the same database, or a different database) open at the same time. Issuing the connect command multiple times will add the new connection to the list of open connections. The "current" connection (against which all SQL statements will be executed) can be switched with the go command. The currently open connections can be listed with the list command.

Issuing SQL commands

Once you are connected to a database, you can begin SQL statements against the current connection. For example:

Example 1. Issuing SQL commands

0: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:mydb> SELECT * FROM MYTABLE;

+-----+
| ID  |
+-----+
| 1   |
| 2   |
| 3   |
| 4   |
+-----+
4 rows selected (0.012 seconds)
0: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:mydb>


Command Completion

On UNIX systems, SQLLine allows command-line completion using the tab key. This will be familiar for users of such popular shells as bash and tcsh. In general, hitting the TAB key when part of the way through typing a command will fill in the rest of the command, or else will display a selection of appropriate possibilities.

autocommit

If true, then new connections will have autocommit set, otherwise, transactions will need to be explicitely committed or rolled back. Defaults to true. To change the autocommit status for a connection that is already open and active, use the autocommit command instead.

autosave

When set to true, any changes to preferences using the set command will cause the preferences to be saved. Otherwise, preferences will need to be explicitely saved using the save command. Defaults to false.

color

If true, then output to the terminal will use color for a more pleasing visual experience. Requires that the terminal support ANSI control codes (most do). Defaults to false.

csvDelimiter

Sets the delimiter in csv outputFormat. Setting to default causes usage of "," as a delimiter.

csvQuoteCharacter

Sets the quote character in csv outputFormat. Setting to default causes usage of '\'' as a delimiter.

dateformat

The format for how date values are displayed. Setting to default causes date values to be fetched and rendered via ResultSet.getString. Any other setting results in fetch via ResultSet.getObject and rendering via java.text.SimpleDateFormat. For example, the setting "YYYY_MM_dd" yields values like "1970_01_01".

escapeOutput

When set to true, control symbols in output will be escaped. Otherwise they will be printed as is. Default is false.

fastconnect

When false, any new connection will cause SQLLine to access information about the available tables and columns in order to provide them as candidates for tab-completion. This can be a very slow operation for some databases, do by default it is off. Table and column information can always be explicitly retrieved using the rehash command.

force

When set to false, any failures during the execution of the run or record commands will cause execution to abort, preventing the execution of subsequent commands. When set to true, errors will be displayed but otherwise ignored. Defaults to false.

headerinterval

The interval between which the column headers will be redisplayed when using the "table" outputformat. Defaults to 100.

historyfile

The file to which SQLLine will save a record of all the commands issued. Defaults to HOME/sqlline/history on Windows, and HOME/.sqlline/history on all other platforms.

incremental

When set to false, the entire result set is fetched and buffered before being displayed, yielding optimal display column sizing. When set to true, result rows are displayed immediately as they are fetched, yielding lower latency and memory usage at the price of extra display column padding. Defaults to false.

isolation

The default transaction isolation that will be used for new connections. To change the isolation level of the currently active connection, use the isolation command instead.

maxcolumnwidth

The maximum column width to display for each column before truncating data when using the "table" outputformat. Defaults to 15.

maxHistoryFileRows

The maximum number of history rows to store in history file. Defaults to 10000 (org.jline.reader.impl.history.DefaultHistory.DEFAULT_HISTORY_FILE_SIZE).

maxHistoryRows

The maximum number of history rows to store in memory. Defaults to 500 (org.jline.reader.impl.history.DefaultHistory.DEFAULT_HISTORY_SIZE).

maxwidth

The maximum width to display before truncating data when using the "table" outputformat. Defaults to attempting to query the terminal for the current width, falls back to 80.

nullvalue

The value which will be used instead of null values. Setting to default causes 'null' for numbers/dates/times and empty strings for others. For example, the setting *** yields null values like '***'

numberformat

The format for how numeric values are displayed. Setting to default causes numeric values to be fetched and rendered via ResultSet.getString. Any other setting results in fetch via ResultSet.getObject and rendering via java.text.DecimalFormat. For example, the setting "0.###E0" yields scientific notation with up to three fractional digits, values like "6.022E23".

outputformat

The format for how results are displayed. For details, see the information on the outputformat command.

rowlimit

The maximum number of rows to fetch per query. Defaults to 0, which is interpreted as fetching all rows.

showheader

If true, display the names of the columns when displaying results. Defaults to true.

shownestederrs

If true, display any nested errors that are reported on the connection after issuing any database commands. Defaults to false, meaning only the topmost error is displayed.

showtime

If true, display execution time for database commands when in verbose mode. Defaults to true.

showwarnings

If true, display any warnings that are reported on the connection after issuing any database commands. Defaults to true.

silent

If true, then reduce the amount of informational messages displayed. Useful for redirecting a sqlline command to a file for later parsing. Defaults to false.

timeformat

The format for how time values are displayed. Setting to default causes time values to be fetched and rendered via ResultSet.getString. Any other setting results in fetch via ResultSet.getObject and rendering via java.text.SimpleDateFormat. For example, the setting "HH:mm:ss" yields values like "14:12:11".

timestampformat

The format for how timestamp values are displayed. Setting to default causes timestamp values to be fetched and rendered via ResultSet.getString. Any other setting results in fetch via ResultSet.getObject and rendering via java.text.SimpleDateFormat. For example, the setting "dd/MM/YYYY'T'HH:mm:ss" yields values like "01/01/1970T12:32:12".

trimscripts

If true, then trim leading and trailing whitespace from lines as they are processed in scripts; otherwise, preserve whitespace. Defaults to true.

verbose

If true, then print out the entire java stack trace whenever an error occurs, as well as displaying debugging information. Defaults to false.
